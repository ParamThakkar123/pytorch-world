"""Block-diagonal GRU used by the DreamerV3 sequence model.

A standard GRU's recurrent weights grow quadratically with the number of hidden
units, which makes wide recurrent states expensive. DreamerV3 instead splits the
recurrent state into ``blocks`` equally sized groups and applies a separate
recurrent weight matrix within each group. Parameters and FLOPs then grow
linearly in the number of units for a fixed block size.

Mixing between blocks is not lost: the GRU input at each step is a dense linear
embedding of the sampled latent, the action, *and* the previous recurrent state,
so information can still cross block boundaries once per timestep.
